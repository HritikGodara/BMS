# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++ Console Application)

A simple **Bank Management System** built in C++ for learning purposes. This console-based application allows **Admins** and **Clients** to perform essential banking operations using in-memory data structures.

## 📌 Features

- Admin and Client login modes
- Create, view, update, and delete bank accounts
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Simple user authentication (hardcoded)
- Menu-driven terminal interface

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming
- **Memory:** Dynamic Allocation (`new`, `delete`)
- **Data Structure:** Singly Linked List

## 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms Used

- **Singly Linked List**  
  Each bank account is stored in a node of a linked list.

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**  
  Accounts and nodes are created/deleted dynamically using `new` and `delete`.

- **Linear Search**  
  Used to search for accounts by account number.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`).
2. Compile the source code:
   ```bash
   g++ bank_management.cpp -o bank_management
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./bank_management
   ```

> ⚠️ **Note:** This application does not use file storage — all data is lost when the program exits.
